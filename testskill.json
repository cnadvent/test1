Within various platforms available, AEM has proven to be a digital experience management solution that has been earning high accolades according to surveys by US research firms Forrester Research and Gartner. However, it requires certain level of technology and project management skills to build a platform that meets customer expectation.  Quick Win for Digital Experience offers a pre-implementation Proof of Concept (hereafter, PoC) period that enables customers to verify desired objectives and imagine AEM utilization. During the PoC period, customers will experience the AEM usability by using our prototype Core Development Framework. Also in this period, we will conduct a survey for identifying the current operational issues and addressing in advance challenges and tasks that will be confronted after the implementation. By using our consulting methods and frameworks that Dentsu Isobar has been accumulated throughout a track record of AEM projects, we support in facilitating the utilization of AEM.
